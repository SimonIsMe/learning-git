                <p>To ride the storm, to an empire of the cloud
                    To ride the storm, they climbed aboard their silver ghost
                    To ride the storm, to a kingdom that will come
                    To ride the storm, and damn the rest, oblivion
                    
                    Royalty and dignitaries, brandy and cigars
                    Gray lady giant of the skies, you hold them in your arms
                    The millionth chance they laughed, to take down
                    His Majesty’s craft
                    “To India” they say, “magic carpet float away”, an October fateful day
